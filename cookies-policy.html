    <p>
        By using the Shine Bathroom website and any other website (including
        mobile-optimized websites) owned or controlled by Shine Bathroom
        Technologies Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively referred
        to as, “Shine Bathroom”, “we”, “us” or “our”) and which links to this
        Cookies Policy (collectively, the “Website”) you consent to the use of
        cookies in accordance with this Cookies Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What are cookies?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are
        downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent
        back to the originating web domain on your subsequent visits to that
        domain. Most web pages contain elements from multiple web domains so when
        you visit the website, your browser may receive cookies from several
        sources.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user’s
        device. Cookies allow you to navigate between pages efficiently, remember
        preferences and generally improve the user experience. They can also be
        used to tailor advertising to your interests through tracking your browsing
        across websites.
    </p>
    <p>
        Session cookies are deleted automatically when you close your browser and
        persistent cookies remain on your device after the browser is closed (for
        example to remember your user preferences when you return to the site).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What types of cookies do we use?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We describe the categories of cookies we and our contractors use below.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Strictly Necessary Cookies</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the
        Website and use its features. Without these cookies, services you have
        asked for (such as navigating between pages) cannot be provided.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Performance Cookies</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        We make use of analytics cookies to analyze how our visitors use our
        Website and to monitor Website performance. This allows us to provide a
        high-quality experience by customizing our offering and quickly identifying
        and fixing any issues that arise. For example, we might use performance
        cookies to keep track of which pages are most popular, which method of
        linking between pages is most effective, and to determine why some pages
        are receiving error messages. We might also use these cookies to highlight
        articles or site services that we think will be of interest to you based on
        your usage of the website. The information collected by these cookies is
        not associated with your personal information by us or by our contractors.

    </p>
    <p>
        We make use of cookies to provide you with certain functionality. For
        example, to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or
        the region you are in), or to recognize the platform from which you access

    <p>
        In addition to the above cookies, we may use Local Shared Objects, also
        referred to as “flash cookies,” on our Website. These are used to enhance
        your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and
        settings. Local Shared Objects are similar to browser cookies, but can
        store data more complex than simple text. By themselves, they cannot do
        anything to or with the data on your computer. Like other cookies, they can
        only access personally identifiable information that you have provided on
        the website, and cannot be accessed by other websites. To find out more

</p>
<p>
    IV. Co-sponsor(s) if we obtain your information in connection with a

<p>
    V. Regulators worldwide, as required by law, including in connection with

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Do Not Track Disclosures</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with
    which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers
    incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users
    intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware
    of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what,
    if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, we
    currently do not change our tracking practices (which are explained in more
    detail directly above) in response to "do-not-track" (DNT) settings in your
    web browser. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we
    will reassess how to respond to these signals.
</p>
<p>
    Our third-party partners, such as ad networks, web analytics companies and
    social media and networking platforms, collect information about your
    online activities over time and across our Site and other online
    properties. These third parties may not change their tracking practices in
    response to DNT settings in your web browser and we do not obligate these
    parties to honor DNT settings. Information about how to opt out from your
    data being used by third parties can be found above under "<em>Site usage information,</em>	<em>cookies and other information collected by automated means</em>."
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Social Networking</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We maintain a presence on several social networking and blogging platforms,
    such as Facebook, Instagram, WordPress, Twitter, and Pinterest. We may
    incorporate some third-party social networking features onto our Site
    (including, allowing users to interact with others and share certain Site
    content and information on social media platforms) or utilize third-party
    provided platforms to publish or manage the Site or portions thereof.
    Through these platforms and features, we receive or may share information
    about you, and this Privacy Notice applies to that information as well. In
    addition, some providers of third-party social networking or blogging
    platforms we utilize (such as Facebook, Instagram, WordPress, Twitter, and
    Pinterest) have their own privacy policies which explain how the third
    parties that provide them may collect, use and protect your information (	<em>e.g.</em>, if you establish an account with such platform providers
    directly). By using the social networking features, you agree to those
    third parties’ privacy policies and terms of use.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, you may be able to use your Facebook or other social
    networking platform login to set up an account on the Site. If you wish to
    use your Facebook or other social media account to log into the Site, your
    information may be shared with us for the purpose of setting up your
    account on the Site and as otherwise provided in those platforms’ privacy
    policies and terms of use.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Mobile Apps</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may make available mobile applications (or "apps") that you are able to
    download and use from your mobile device. Depending on the nature and
    functionality of the app, we may collect personal information and
    non-personally identifiable usage information through the app, any features
    on your mobile device to which you grant us access. The app also may
    collect information about your mobile device, such as your ID for
    Advertisers (IDFA) or Advertising ID, the IP address of your mobile device,
    device type, operating system and connection information (<em>e.g.</em>,
    Wi-Fi, LTE, 4G, 3G). If you opt-in, some of our apps may collect your
    device’s precise real-time location, and in such cases, you may be able to
    opt out from further allowing us to have access to such location data by
    managing your location preferences in the app and/or on your device. This
    Privacy Notice may be supplemented from time to time with additional terms
    applicable to individual apps, or individual apps may be subject to
    separate privacy notices or policies of which we will notify you by posting
    them on such apps.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Payment and Third-Party Payment Processors</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Purchases made through the Site may be processed through a third-party
    payment processor, application, or other payment service provider (each, a
    "Payment Processor"). If applicable, you may be provided a notice when
    accessing the payment application or entering your payment information
    directing you to such Payment Processor’s terms of use and privacy policy,
    and all payments are governed by such terms of use and privacy policy.

</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Legal basis for processing data</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    In this section, we identify the legal grounds on which we rely to process
    personal information.
</p>
<p>
    In some cases, we have a legitimate interest to process the personal
    information that we collect, such as to develop, administer and support our
    products and services; to operate, evaluate and improve our business; to
    facilitate and manage engagement programs; to promote research; to support
    our recruitment activities; or to facilitate a Corporate Transaction
    (including a sale of assets or merger or acquisition).
</p>
<p>
    In other cases, we process personal information to fulfill our contracts
    with business partners, such as third parties that distribute our products.
</p>
<p>
    It may be also necessary for us to process personal information to
    establish, exercise or defend against fraud, illegal activity, and claims
    and other liabilities, including by enforcing the terms and conditions that
    govern the services we provide.
</p>
<p>
    Our processing of certain information may be necessary to comply with our
    legal obligations, and for reasons of public interest, such as with respect
    to adverse event and product safety reporting.
</p>
<p>
    We may also process personal information as specifically permitted by
    applicable legal requirements.
</p>
<p>
    If we rely on consent for the processing of your personal information, we
    will seek such consent at the time we collect your personal information.
    For more information on consent, please see the "Additional international
    privacy preferences and rights" section of this Privacy Notice.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>International data transfers</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may transfer your personal information to countries other than the
    country in which the data was originally collected for the purposes
    described in this Privacy Notice. For example, if you are located outside
    of the United States, we may transfer your personal information to the
    United States, where Shine Bathroom is headquartered. The countries to
    which we transfer personal information may not have the same data
    protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the
    information. When we transfer personal information across borders, we
    consider a variety of requirements that may apply to such transfers.
</p>
<p>
    Specifically, we may transfer personal information from the European
    Economic Area or the United Kingdom to:
</p>
<p>
    Countries that the European Commissions has deemed to adequately safeguard
    personal information,
</p>
<p>
    Pursuant to the recipient’s compliance with standard contractual clauses,
    EU-US Privacy Shield, or Binding Corporate Rules,
</p>
<p>
    Pursuant to the consent of the individual to whom the personal information
    pertains, or
</p>
<p>
    As otherwise permitted by applicable EEA requirements.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>EU-U.S. Privacy Shield</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    We comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the
    U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of
    personal information transferred from the European Union to the United
    States. We have certified to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to
    the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms
    in this Privacy Notice and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy
    Shield Principles shall take precedence. To learn more about the Privacy

        Privacy Shield Principles

    , Shine Bathroom is accountable for personal information that it receives
    and subsequently transfers to third parties. If third parties that process
    personal information on our behalf do so in a manner that does not comply
    with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are accountable, unless we prove
    that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
</p>
<p>
    Should you feel that we have not complied with the Privacy Shield
    principles and the handling of your personal data and we have not been able
    to remedy your complaint ourselves, you may wish to contact JAMS who is our

    <strong><em>Your California privacy rights</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    California’s "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires
    certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking
    about the businesses’ practices related to disclosing personal information
    to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
    Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose
    personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’
    direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to
    opt-out of such information-sharing. As discussed above, if we share
    Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes you
    will be able to elect for us not to do so by emailing us at	<a href="mailto:privacy@shinebathroom.com">privacy@shinebathroom.com</a>
    (please include your name, mailing address, and email address). To find out
    more about your opt-out rights, see the "Opt In and Opt Out" section above.

        <em>Additional international privacy preferences and rights</em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Individuals in certain jurisdictions, like the EEA, have certain rights and
    choices regarding our processing of their personal information. We have
    appointed a data protection officer ("DPO") as a point of contact for
    exercising these rights. Please see the "How to Contact Us" section below
    for the DPO’s contact information. In some cases where your personal
    information is accessible through an online portal or platform, you may be
    able to directly exercise these rights by following the instructions on the
    portal or platform.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to
    process personal information, we may be precluded from providing our
    products or services to individuals who exercise these rights, or from
    otherwise engaging with such individuals going forward.
</p>
<p>
    We reserve the right to verify the identity of the individual in connection
    with any requests regarding personal information to help ensure that we
    provide the information to individuals to whom the information pertains and
    allow only those individuals or their authorized representatives to
    exercise rights with respect to that information.
</p>
<p>
    For information about the rights and choices users have with respect to
    cookies and online tracking, please see the "

    To the extent provided by applicable law, you may withdraw any consent you
    previously provided to us, or object at any time on legitimate grounds, to

    <strong>How we Protect Personal Information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We use various efforts intended to safeguard the security and integrity of
    personal information collected on our Sites. Payment card information is
    processed by third-party Payment Processors pursuant to their applicable
    privacy policies. Despite these measures, however, we cannot and do not
    guarantee that information will be absolutely safe from interception or
    intrusion during transmission or while stored on our system, or otherwise.
</p>
<p>
    If you correspond with us by e-mail, text message or using Web forms like a
    "contact us" feature on our Sites, you should be aware that your
    transmission might not be secure from access by unauthorized parties. We
    have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or
    unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission. If you

    confidentiality of your account password and for any activity that occurs
    under your account. Please notify us of any unauthorized use of your
    password or account.

    may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you. If we have your
    e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail to the most recent e-mail
    address you have provided us in your account profile. Please keep your
    e-mail address in your account up to date. You can change that e-mail
    address any time in your account profile. If you receive a notice from us,
    you can print it to retain a copy of it. To receive these notices, you must
    check your e-mail account using your computer or mobile device and email
    application software. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such
    notification. If you prefer for us to use the U.S. Postal Service to notify
    you in this situation, please e-mail us at	<a href="mailto:privacy@shinebathroom.com">privacy@shinebathroom.com</a>
    (please include your name, mailing address, and email address). You can
    make this election any time, and it will apply to notifications we make
    after a reasonable time thereafter for us to process your request. You may
    also use this e-mail address to request a print copy, at no charge, of an
    electronic notice we have sent to you regarding a compromise of your
    personal information.
